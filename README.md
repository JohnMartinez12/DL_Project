The data for the challenge can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/landmark-retrieval-challenge/data

Run vgg.py to generate feature vectors of the query and test images, which are saved as .npy files in their respective directories. 

Then, run kmeans_tf.py to cluster these feature vectors and generate a submission csv. 

The rest of the scripts here are just tests of different methods.
