The Google Landmark Retreival and Recognition Challenges are computer vision challenges that in- volve identifying the same landmark in multiple im- ages. In the Retreival challenge, we are given a query image for which we must find similar images. In the Recognition challenge, we must classify test images as containing the same landmark as at most one im- age from the training set. We used VGG Net and Kmeans for our first submission. We are currently in leaderboard position 46 (top 40%) for the Retrieval challenge with a score of 0.024 and in position 112 (top 47%) for the Recognition challenge with a score of 0.000. We are now working with DELF to improve our ranks and accuracy.
